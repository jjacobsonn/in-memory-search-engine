# Swagger Usage Guide

## Accessing Swagger UI
FastAPI automatically generates a Swagger UI for your API. To access it, navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

## Using Swagger UI
- **Explore Endpoints:** View all available endpoints and their details.
- **Try Out Endpoints:** Execute API calls directly from the UI.
- **View Responses:** See the response status and body for each API call.

## Benefits
- **Interactive Documentation:** Easily understand and test API endpoints.
- **Auto-generated:** Always up-to-date with your API code.
