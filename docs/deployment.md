# Deployment Guide

## Pre-deployment
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -v`
- Review the CI/CD pipeline in .github/workflows/test.yml

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push changes to the remote repository.
2. Deploy the API to a staging server:
   - Run: `uvicorn api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` on the staging environment.
3. Verify that all API endpoints function as expected using tools like Postman.
4. Monitor logs and performance; update monitoring configurations if needed.

## Post-deployment
- Gather feedback and monitor performance metrics.
- Plan iterative improvements based on usage and performance.
