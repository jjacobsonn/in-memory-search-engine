# Deployment Guide

## Pre-deployment
- Ensure all tests pass: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
- Review the CI/CD pipeline in .github/workflows/test.yml

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit and push changes to the remote repository.
2. Deploy the API to a staging server:
   - Run: `python3 -m uvicorn api.app:app` on the staging environment.
3. Verify that all API endpoints function as expected using tools like Postman.
4. Monitor logs and performance; update monitoring configurations if needed.

## Post-deployment
- Gather feedback and monitor performance metrics.
- Plan iterative improvements based on usage and performance.
