With these steps, you can transform your search engine into a public-facing project, complete with a simple demo UI and live hosting—perfect for a portfolio or professional showcase!- If you extend functionality (e.g., synonyms, advanced fuzzy matching), redeploy so visitors see the newest features.- Keep your environment up-to-date with new words or phrases added to data/demo_data.json.## 4. Keeping It Updated- **Analytics:** Collect basic usage analytics (e.g., page views) to highlight your traffic.- **Performance Metrics:** Show or log how fast your search completes.  - **Showcase UX:** Add animations or a small “results preview” dropdown to your search box.  - **Custom Domain:** Configure a custom domain (e.g., `search.myportfolio.com`) to give your API or frontend a professional URL.  ## 3. Tips for a Polished Portfolio   - The backend runs on another platform (Render/Railway) but your end users see a single polished front page.   - Vercel optimizes your frontend for quick loads.2. **Enjoy a Seamless Demo:**     - In your frontend code, set the API base URL to the publicly hosted FastAPI endpoint (e.g., your Render or Railway URL).   - Create a new Vercel project with your JavaScript-based frontend.1. **Host Your Frontend on Vercel:**  ### Option C: Using Vercel for Frontend + External API   - Once deployed, you’ll have a public URL to share or integrate into your website.3. **Test & Share:**     - Railway will detect your Dockerfile and automatically build it.2. **Docker Deployment:**     - Go to https://railway.app/ and select “Deploy From GitHub.”1. **Import Your Repo:**  ### Option B: Deploy to Railway   - Redirect your frontend's API calls to this URL.   - Render will give you a domain (e.g., https://in-memory-se.onrender.com).3. **Check the Live URL:**     - Set the start command to run your container, e.g., `docker run -p 8000:8000 in-memory-se`   - Set the build command to `docker build -t in-memory-se .`2. **Configure Settings:**     - Connect the repository that contains your Dockerfile.   - Sign up at https://render.com/ and create a new “Web Service.”1. **Link Your Repo to Render:**  ### Option A: Deploy to Render (suitable for Docker-based Python apps)## 2. Host Your Application Publicly```// ...existing code...}  );    </div>      {/* ...map over results for display... */}      <input type="text" value={query} onChange={handleAutocomplete} />    <div>  return (  }    }      setResults([]);    } catch {      }        setResults([]);      } else {        setResults(data.results);        const data = await res.json();      if (res.ok) {      const res = await fetch(`/autocomplete?prefix=${prefix}`);    try {    setQuery(prefix);    const prefix = e.target.value;  async function handleAutocomplete(e) {  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");function SearchBox() {// ...existing code...```jsxBelow is a high-level example (React style pseudocode) for the search input, without repeating existing API code:- You can keep it minimal, or style it more elaborately to showcase your UI/UX skills.- Have your frontend send requests to your deployed FastAPI backend (via /autocomplete or /fuzzy).- Use React, Vue, or any framework you prefer.  Create a simple frontend to let users type queries and see autocomplete/fuzzy results in real-time:## 1.
