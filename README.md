# In-Memory Search Engine

This project implements an efficient trie-based search engine with support for autocomplete and fuzzy search. It is designed for rapid lookups and correction of typos.

## Features
- **Trie-Based Indexing:** Fast insertion and lookup for autocomplete.
- **Fuzzy Search:** Uses techniques like Levenshtein distance to handle typos.
- **Efficient Memory Use:** Optimized for performance in memory-sensitive applications.

## Repository Structure
- **src/**: Contains the core implementation (trie and fuzzy search logic).
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., via `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python).
3. Run the project with `python src/main.py`.

## How GitHub Copilot Can Assist
- **Code Suggestions:** Inline comments guide Copilot to generate key functions (e.g., trie insertion and search).
- **Refactoring Hints:** Well-structured modules help Copilot suggest improvements.
